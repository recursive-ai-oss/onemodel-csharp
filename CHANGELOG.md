## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The solution skeleton: library, tests, NativeAOT and browser-wasm smoke apps, micro-benchmarks and a fuzz harness.
- Tensor layer: data types with fp16/bf16 conversion, strided views, NCHW/NHWC/blocked layouts, a pooled allocator and arena, and gradient records (public, unstable until the first preview).
- Fast and exact fp32 matrix-product, convolution, attention and softmax kernels, exact transcendental functions, and a fixed-chunk thread pool (internal for now).
- Tooling: reference-model export and pinning, reference outputs from ONNX Runtime, cross-machine output hashing, and a benchmark runner against ONNX Runtime.
- ONNX import: a protobuf reader and ONNX model reader of our own (IR versions 3 and later, any opset, external data confined to the model's directory, memory-mapped weights), and the graph representation it builds. Bad input produces `OnnxImportException`.
